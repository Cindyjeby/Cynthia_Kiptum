  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cynthia Jebiwott Kiptum</p>
  
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The primary goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to increase new patient bookings by 20% within the next six months. This will be achieved by converting website visitors into patients by prominently featuring the "20% discount on your first dental visit" as a clear call-to-action, which encourages users to book their first appointment via email.The site will also serve to enhance the business's online presence and credibility.</p>
  
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Success will be evaluated by tracking the primary goal. We will measure the number of new patient booking emails sent to admin@100smilesdentalcare.com.au that specifically reference the "20% first visit" website promotion. This provides a direct, quantifiable metric for new patient conversions. We will compare the monthly number of these conversion emails post-launch against a pre-launch baseline to track progress toward the 20% goal.</p>
  
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    1. Target Audience: Our primary target audience is adults and parents (aged 30-50) in the Razole area who are looking for a reliable, "all-in-one" dental provider for their families.These are typically busy individuals who value trust, experience, and the convenience of finding a single clinic that can handle everything from a child's first check-up to adult cosmetic dentistry.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Intentional Design: The website will be intentionally designed for this audience by:
    <ul>
      <li>Building Trust:Prominently featuring the "Our Staff" section and the clinic's 30+ years of community history to establish credibility and a personal connection.</li>
      <li>Clarity and Efficiency:Making contact information, trading hours, and the "Book Now" call-to-action (for the 20% discount) highly visible on every page, so a busy parent can find it quickly.</li>
      <li>Family-Oriented Content: Clearly organising the comprehensive services to show they cover all family needs (e.g., Orthodontics, Check-ups, Implants), and using provided images that reflect a welcoming, family-friendly environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
